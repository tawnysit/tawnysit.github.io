  Hi, I'm Tawny! I am a second-year graduate student in Astronomy at The Ohio State University, working with David Weinberg on galactic chemical evolution and the origin of the elements.
</p>

<p>
Before coming to OSU, I worked with Mansi Kasliwal and the Zwicky Transient Facility group at Caltech on The Census of the Local Universe experiment and studied SN 1987A-like supernovae. Prior to ZTF, I worked with Raja Guhathakurta (UCSC) on identification of distant RR Lyrae stars in the Milky Way halo using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey. As an undergraduate, I also worked with Melissa Ness (at the time Columbia/Flatiron, now ANU) in Summer 2019, Evan Kirby (at the time Caltech, now Notre Dame) in Summer 2018, and Murry Brightman (Caltech)/the NuSTAR group in Summer 2017.
</p>

<p>I graduated from Caltech in 2020 with a BS in Astrophyics and am a proud member of Ricketts Hovse.</p>

<p>Outside of academia, I spend my time dancing and nerding out about specialty coffee, though I also dabble in indoor rock climbing and playing video games.</p>
