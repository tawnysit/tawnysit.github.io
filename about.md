I am a PhD candidate in astronomy at The Ohio State University. I grew up on Long Island, in the New York City suburbs, and was fortunate to get my first taste of astronomy research in high school at Brookhaven National Lab through their [High School Research Program](https://www.bnl.gov/education/programs/program.php?q=219). I graduated from Caltech in 2020 with a BS in Astrophysics and am a proud member of Ricketts Hovse. Afterward, I was lucky enough to continue doing astronomy research during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic before starting graduate school at OSU in 2022. You can read more about my research on my [research page](https://tawnysit.github.io/research/).

I spent much of my childhood at gymnastics practice, competing within the US in the lesser-known discipline of rhythmic gymnastics. Since retiring, I've continued to dance: marching band dance team and Chinese classical dance with a local Chinese center in high school, contemporary and classical ballet with the Caltech Ballet Club, and some self-choreographed contemporary/lyrical work drawing on my gymnastics background. Nowadays, you can find me most nights of the week taking class at my local Columbus studio, [Flux + Flow](https://www.flux-flow.com/)!

Outside of astronomy and dance, I like to cook, be a nerd about specialty coffee, and working on cosplay projects. I also occasionally go indoor rock climbing, attend metal concerts, and attempt to learn how to play video games as an adult.

For those curious about my last name: it's the *Cantonese* romanization of 薛 (Xuē in Mandarin pinyin)!
